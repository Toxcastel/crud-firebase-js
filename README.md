# Basic CRUD with Firebase

This is just an introductory project to quickly learn the basics of Firebase.
The tutorial I am using is from this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ey4k6mW9ds4

It only runs with live server

1. Basic config

- By creating a basic HTML form, at the end of the body tag we'll add type="module" so we can import the functions of firebase.
- index.js file will have the basic config from the firebase documentation
